        <h4> Description: </h4>
        <p>
            In Modern Snake you control a snake whose task it is to eat fruits. With every bite the snake grows.
            The aim of the game is to collect as many fruits as possible. Walls on the board make it difficult to
            collect the fruits.
            With increasing score you get to a higher level with more walls.
            The higher the level, the higher the difficulty.
        </p>

        <h4>Level-Builder: </h4>
        <p>
            With the ingame-levelbuilder you can create your own levels.
            The user can set walls on the game board himself and thus create user-defined levels.
        </p>
